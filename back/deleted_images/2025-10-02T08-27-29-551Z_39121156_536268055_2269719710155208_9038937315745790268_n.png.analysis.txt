REASONING: The image features stylized food characters (a corn cob and a hot dog with anthropomorphic faces) but contains no Schwepe-defining elements such as frogs/amphibians, shiny shades, Schwepe-related text ("schwepe", "247420", etc.), AI-generated/3D-rendered characters, or strong indicators like meme parodies, crypto/trading themes, or viral meme formats. None of the automatic Schwepe criteria or strong indicators apply, so it is not Schwepe-related.<|end_of_box|>
