REASONING: The video features a person reacting to an AI-generated image (a winged goldfish over a city) via the "Sora" app. There are no definitive Schwepe characteristics (frogs, shiny shades, Schwepe text) and no strong indicators (meme parodies of Schwepe characters, crypto/trading themes, or explicit meme culture references tied to Schwepe). The content focuses on AI image generation rather than Schwepe-related meme elements.<|end_of_box|>
