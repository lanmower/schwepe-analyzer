REASONING: The image features a stylized cartoon figure in an old, dilapidated room, but there are no definitive Schwepe characteristics (no frogs, sunglasses, or Schwepe-related text) and no strong indicators (no recognizable meme parodies, crypto/trading themes, or explicit meme culture elements). While the character has a simplified, meme-like art style, it does not qualify as a meme parody or fit other strong Schwepe criteria, so it is not classified as Schwepe-related.<|end_of_box|>
