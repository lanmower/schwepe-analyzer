REASONING: The image shows a pixelated green pig-like creature with a club, which is a recognizable retro video game character (not a frog/amphibian, no shiny shades, no Schwepe-related text). It lacks any strong indicators like meme parodies, crypto/trading themes, or meme culture elements. Since none of the definitive or strong Schwepe criteria are met, it is not Schwepe-related.<|end_of_box|>
