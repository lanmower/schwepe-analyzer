REASONING: The video features a person interacting with an AI tool (Sora) to generate an image, with no presence of frogs/amphibians, shiny shades, Schwepe-related text, or recognizable meme parodies/characters. While the reaction could be a common meme format, it does not meet any of the defined Schwepe criteria (definite or strong indicators). Thus, it is not Schwepe-related.<|end_of_box|>
