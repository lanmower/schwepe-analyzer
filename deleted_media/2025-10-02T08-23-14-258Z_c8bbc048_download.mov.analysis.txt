REASONING: The characterâ€™s costume does not clearly resemble a frog/amphibian (definite Schwepe trait), there are no shiny shades or Schwepe-related text. While the scene involves skateboarding (a common meme activity), the costume itself is not a recognizable meme parody or reference to established Schwepe characteristics. Without explicit alignment to any Schwepe criteria, it is not classified as Schwepe-related.<|end_of_box|>
